# Q1 – Dockerfile with Basic Linux Commands  
**Author:** Aaman Shaikh  
**Course:** DevOps – MIT World Peace University  

This repository contains the solution for **Question 1**, in which I created a Dockerfile that runs a shell script demonstrating basic Linux commands. The Dockerfile is built and pushed to GitHub, along with this README explaining DevOps concepts, steps followed, and how this assignment helped me learn DevOps tools.

## 📌 1. Five DevOps Concepts

### **1. Continuous Integration (CI)**
Developers frequently merge code to a shared repository, where automated builds and tests help detect errors early.

### **2. Continuous Deployment (CD)**
Every code change automatically moves through a pipeline to production once it passes testing.

### **3. Version Control (Git)**
Source code is tracked using commits, branches, and repositories. It makes collaboration easier and provides a full history of changes.

### **4. Containerization (Docker)**
Applications run in isolated containers that include everything needed (code, OS, dependencies). This ensures portability and consistency.

### **5. Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**
Infrastructure (servers, networks, configurations) is defined and managed using code instead of manual setup, allowing automation and scalability.

### **▶ Step 1: Initialize the Project Folder**
I created a folder and moved inside it:

```bash
mkdir My-docker-appp
cd My-docker-appp
